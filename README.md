Steps to build the app on your local device:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install flutter if you don't already have it. Please already have Android Studio or Xcode for IOS users
3. run ```flutter pub get``` in the frontend folder
4. Connect your device to your computer. It is also possible to use a simulator, but some features such as the camera 
and bank login will not work on it
5. run ```flutter run``` in the frontend folder
6. Wait an eternity
7. The app should now run!
